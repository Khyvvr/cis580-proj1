CIS 580 PROJECT 2 DETAILS:
I decided to build off of game project 1 as upon the due date my collision wasn't quite working correctly and I was overall just not quite satisfied with my work. Here are the differences between projec1 and project2:
	- new and improved art/sprites (changes affect the look of the background, paddles, and nets)
	- game now includes 4 new sound effects for the different puck collisions (wall, paddle, net, victory) -> per project 2 requirements
	- implemented an animated scoreboard -> per project 2 requirements
	- implemented SpriteFonts for the victory screen instead of sprite images -> per project 2 requirements


TRIPLE THREAT AIR HOCKEY SIMULATOR README:

Welcome to Triple Threat Air Hockey Simulator!

This is a 2 player game that simulates a cross between air hockey and classic pong.

The goal of this game is to score 3 points before your opponent. To score, the puck must reach the opponent's net which will be moving vertically (up and down) behind their paddles.

Controls:
Blue team
	- W: up
	- S: down
	- Esc: Exit Game

Red Team
	- I: up
	- K: down
	- Esc: Exit Game


Note to keep the game fun and interesting the puck's speed fluxuates randomly after being hit by a paddle. This is to simulate the randomly affecting friction from an air hockey table.
Furthermore, the nets will also spawn with a different speed every time the game is started to agian keep things fun and interesting (sometimes they may not move at all, although this is very rare).
