This game is a cross between classic pong and air hockey.

The goal of the game is to score 3 points before your opponent. To score, the puck must reach your opponent's net displayed by a black box.

A helpful hint to play this game is also that as the puck collides with a player's paddle(s) the puck's speed and direction change randomly to simulate the way an air hockey puck moves on an air hockey table.

Note for grading purposes: for some reason the collision between the puck and paddles seem to only work every so often on the left side (red) whereas the right side works just fine(blue)
