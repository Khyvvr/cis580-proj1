Welcome to Triple Threat Air Hockey Simulator!

This is a 2 player game that simulates a cross between air hockey and classic pong.

The goal of this game is to score 3 points before your opponent. To score, the puck must reach the opponent's net which will be moving vertically (up and down) behind their paddles.

Controls:
Blue team
	- W: up
	- S: down
	- Esc: Exit Game

Red Team
	- I: up
	- K: down
	- Esc: Exit Game


Note to keep the game fun and interesting the puck's speed fluxuates randomly after being hit by a paddle. This is to simulate the randomly affecting friction from an air hockey table.
Furthermore, the nets will also spawn with a different speed every time the game is started to agian keep things fun and interesting (sometimes they may not move at all, although this is very rare).
